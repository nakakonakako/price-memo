# price-memo

## Project source of truth

Before making non-trivial changes, read `docs/project-overview.md`.

Also inspect the relevant `docs/spec-*.md` before changing documented behavior.

When features, environment, architecture, dependencies, or data models change,
update `docs/project-overview.md` and the relevant specification.

## Product boundary

This repository is Feature B: strict unit-price comparison.

Responsibilities include:
- manually selected product folders
- confirmed weight / quantity / volume data
- strict unit-price calculation
- price trends
- store comparison
- shopping memo functionality

Do NOT turn this repository into a household expense manager.

Do not introduce:
- AI automatic expense categories
- general household expense tracking
- approximate package weights as confirmed data

`price-memo` may optionally reference receipt data from `receipt-manager`,
but it must remain functional without `receipt-manager`.

The dependency direction is B -> A only.
Do not introduce A -> B dependencies.

## Stack

Frontend:
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase client

Backend:
- Python
- FastAPI
- Supabase
- uv

## Verification

For frontend changes:

    npm run lint --prefix frontend
    npm run build --prefix frontend

For backend changes:

    uv run --directory backend ruff check .
    uv run --directory backend ruff format --check .

## Database safety

Do not run:

    npm run db:push

unless the user explicitly requests a database push.

## Implementation rules

- Never introduce TypeScript `any`.
- Preserve exact unit semantics and avoid guessed values.
- Follow existing architecture before adding abstractions.
- Prefer small focused changes.
- When changing shared A/B behavior, inspect the integration specification first.
